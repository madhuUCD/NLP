# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Customer Feedback using Python

Sentiment analysis, also refers as opinion mining, is a sub machine learning task where we want to determine the general sentiment of a given document. Using machine learning techniques and natural language processing we can extract the subjective information of a document and try to classify it according to its polarity such as positive, neutral or negative. It is a really useful analysis since we could possibly determine the overall opinion about selling objects, or predict stock markets for a given company like, if most people think positive about it, possibly its stock markets will increase, and so on. Sentiment analysis is actually far from to be solved since the language is very complex (objectivity/subjectivity, negation, vocabulary, grammar, etc.. but it is also why it is very interesting to working on. 
In this project I choose to try to classify customer feedback from Amazon into “positive” or “negative” sentiment by building a model based on probabilities. The dataset can be obtained from ‘Google datasets’ or ‘Kaggle’. Computers can’t understand text so text has to be converted into a format which is comprehended by the computer


Get the dataset from my github.

## Requirement

We can use multiple programming languages like Python, R, SAS etc.. to classify whether a review is 'Positive' or 'Negative'.But for this project I have used Python since it is ubiquitous, open-source and easy to learn.
Python is a general purpose programming language if you want to know more about python follow this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))

And I have used **Jupyter Notebook** to develop the project.Jupyter is a free, open-source, interactive web tool known as a computational notebook, which researchers can use to combine software code, computational output, explanatory text and multimedia resources in a single document.

#### How to Install Python and Jupyter Notebooks  

Installing Python, Jupyter Noteboks and setting the envirnment with required packages or libraries would be cumbersome for a newbie, so I have installed **Anaconda** which would install Python and Jupyter Notebook by default.

Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows) for windows



  
## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```
  npm install my-project
  cd my-project
```
    
## Usage/Examples

```javascript
import Component from 'my-project'

function App() {
  return <Component />
}
```
